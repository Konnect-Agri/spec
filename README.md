# Beckn Spec for Agriculture

This folder contains the Beckn Protocol Specification v1.0.0 taken from the official [protocol-specification repository in the Beckn github organisation](https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications/blob/master/api/transaction/build/transaction.yaml).

Right now this specification is the unedited version of the original core beckn specification v1.0.0, but necessary changes required to be made to adopt the specification for the domain of Agriculture will be done and maintained here.
